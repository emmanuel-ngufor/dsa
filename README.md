| Minimum Spanning Trees | Greedy algorithms for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted, undirected graph. Prim's = pick a node. Kruskal's = iterate through edges. | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZObEi3Hf6lmyW-CBfs7nkOV) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/tree/master/minimum_spanning_trees) | 
| Shortest Path Algos | Dijkstra's = shortest path from one node to all nodes. Bellman‚ÄìFord = shortest path from one node to all nodes, negative edges allowed (not negative cycles). Floyd‚ÄìWarshall = shortest path between all pairs of vertices, negative edges allowed (not negative cycles). | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZO-Y-H3xIC9DGSfVYJng9Yw) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/tree/master/shortest_path) | 
| Maximum Flow Algos | Algorithms that compute the maximum flow in a flow network. Ford‚ÄìFulkerson = greedy. | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZPxifnyXjQVU1bhU4b4_Ts2) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/tree/master/maximum_flow) |
| Search Algos | Searching arrays and tree data structures. | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZMIAJn8M6At9CjZ0Wu0B31d) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/tree/master/search) |
| Sort Algos | Sorting unordered arrays. | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZOZSbGAXAPIq1BeUf4j20pl) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/tree/master/sort) |
| Tree Traversal Algos | Traversing binary search trees. | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZO1JC2RgEi04nLy6D-rKk6b) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/tree/master/tree_traversal) |
| Red-Black Trees | Self-balancing binary search trees with red and black nodes. | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZNqDI8qfOZgzbqahCUmUEin) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/blob/master/trees/red_black_tree.py) |
| AVL Trees | Self-balancing binary search trees with nodes that have a balance factor of -1, 0, or 1. Balance factor = height of left child - height of right child. | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZOUFgdIeOPuH6cfSnNRMau-) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/blob/master/trees/avl_tree.py) |
| B-Trees | Self-balancing search trees with nodes that may have more than two children. Well suited for databases and file systems. | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZNFPPv98DjTdD9X6UI9KMHz) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/blob/master/trees/b_tree.py) |
| Heaps | Nearly complete binary trees useful for priority queues (min‚Äìheaps) and heap sort (max‚Äìheaps). | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZNsyqgPW-DNwUeT8F8uhWc6) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/blob/master/data_structures/heap.py) |
| Fibonacci Heaps | Data structure that implements a mergeable heap. | [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9xmBV_5YoZNkwWDXcSiZjMgacw2P0U2j) | [Code](https://github.com/msambol/dsa/blob/master/data_structures/fibonacci_heap.py) |
